# Credit Risk Assessment App

This project is a machine learning-powered web application that assesses the creditworthiness of individuals or businesses and predicts the risk of default on loans or credit lines.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Data-driven risk assessment using machine learning.
- Clean and interactive web interface using Dash.
- Hosted and accessible online via Render.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

### 1. Data Collection & Exploration
- Researched and selected datasets from public sources like Kaggle and UCI.
- Performed EDA, cleaned data, and preprocessed for modeling.

### 2. Model Development
- Trained and evaluated various ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
- Used cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy.

### 3. Web Application
- Built with Dash, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Provides an intuitive interface for input and prediction results.

### 4. Deployment
- Deployed on [Render](https://render.com/) for live usage.
- Ensured proper configuration and environment setup.

### 5. Testing & Validation
- Extensively tested for usability and accuracy.
- Validated predictions with ground-truth data.
