# Credit Risk Assessment Project Report

## 1. Introduction
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can assess the creditworthiness of individuals or businesses and predict the likelihood of default on loans or credit lines. The solution is deployed as a web application using Dash, allowing users to input data and receive predictions interactively.

## 2. Dataset Description

### 2.1 Data Sources
- Public datasets from Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or government databases.

### 2.2 Features
- Demographic information (e.g., age, income, employment status)
- Financial history (e.g., previous defaults, loan amounts, payment history)
- Behavioral indicators (e.g., credit utilization, number of open accounts)

### 2.3 Target Variable
- Binary classification target: **Default (Yes/No)**

### 2.4 Data Pre-processing
- Handled missing values with imputation techniques.
- Removed outliers using IQR method.
- Encoded categorical variables using one-hot and label encoding.
- Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler.
- Split into 80% training and 20% testing sets.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized distributions of numeric features.
- Analyzed correlation heatmaps to identify predictive variables.
- Identified class imbalance in target variable and addressed it using techniques like SMOTE.
